# @any-tdf/react-confetti

React port of `svelte-confetti@2.3.2`.

The component renders pure HTML and CSS animation markup. It does not use canvas, timers for animation frames, or runtime physics. The goal is API and visual behavior parity with `svelte-confetti`, with React-only `className` and `style` passthrough for integration.

## Install

```sh
bun add @any-tdf/react-confetti
```

```tsx
import { Confetti } from '@any-tdf/react-confetti';

export const Demo = () => <Confetti rounded amount={100} />;
```

## Documentation

This package ships with a standalone React documentation site under `docs/site`.

```sh
bun install
bun run docs:dev
bun run docs:build
```

The site mirrors the demo structure and API coverage from `svelte-confetti@2.3.2`, with Chinese and English content.

## Props

| Prop | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `size` | `10` | Maximum size in pixels for each confetti piece. |
| `x` | `[-0.5, 0.5]` | Horizontal range multiplier. `[-1, 1]` means up to `200px` left and right. |
| `y` | `[0.25, 1]` | Vertical range multiplier. Negative values move downward, positive values move upward. |
| `duration` | `2000` | Animation duration for each piece in milliseconds. |
| `infinite` | `false` | Loops the animation indefinitely. Overrides `iterationCount`. |
| `delay` | `[0, 50]` | Random delay range for each piece in milliseconds. |
| `colorRange` | `[0, 360]` | HSL hue range used when `colorArray` is empty. |
| `colorArray` | `[]` | CSS color values to pick from randomly. Supports gradients and image backgrounds. |
| `amount` | `50` | Number of confetti pieces. Large values can affect performance. |
| `iterationCount` | `1` | CSS `animation-iteration-count`; accepts numbers, `infinite`, `initial`, or `inherit`. |
| `fallDistance` | `"100px"` | CSS distance each piece falls after the burst. |
| `rounded` | `false` | Renders circular pieces. |
| `cone` | `false` | Shapes the burst as a cone. |
| `noGravity` | `false` | Uses a constant-speed explosion without the falling stage. |
| `xSpread` | `0.15` | Horizontal spread from `0` to `1`. Lower values keep peak and end X positions closer. |
| `destroyOnComplete` | `true` | Removes the markup after finite animations complete on the client. |
| `disableForReducedMotion` | `false` | Disables animation when `prefers-reduced-motion` is active. |
| `className` | `""` | Extra class name for the holder element. |
| `style` | `undefined` | Extra inline styles for the holder element. |

## Notes

- The CSS trajectory, timing variables, gravity behavior, cone behavior, reduced-motion behavior, and default values are based on `svelte-confetti@2.3.2`.
- The component is SSR-friendly. Server rendering outputs the same holder and piece markup; client-side cleanup only runs after mount.
- Random piece values are generated from prop values, not array prop identities, so parent re-renders with equivalent inline ranges do not restart the burst.
